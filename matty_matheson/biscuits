Ingredients

2 ½ cups|380 grams all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons baking powder
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 ½ teaspoon kosher salt
8 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cubed
1 cup buttermilk
1 large egg
1 teaspoon flaky sea salt

1. Heat the oven to 425°F. In a large bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. 
Using a pastry blender, cut in cold butter until it resembles a course crumb. 
Gently fold in buttermilk and knead to incorporate.

2. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface. Pat the dough into a 3/4-inch thick rectangle and 
fold the dough over onto itself a total of 5 or 6 times. Pat the dough out again into a rectangle and, 
using a biscuit cutter, cut out the biscuits making sure to cut straight down and up, instead of twisting 
the cutter as you are pulling it out of the dough (this will seal the edges of the dough, not allowing 
the layers of the biscuit to form or rise). Using a 2 ½-inch circle cutter, cut 7 to 8 biscuits.

3. Transfer biscuits to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Brush the tops of the biscuits with the egg 
and sprinkle with the sea salt. Bake until golden, about 15 minutes. Serve warm with butter.
